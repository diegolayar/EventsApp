# Events App

iOS application that displays a list of 250 events in the United States fetched from the SeatGeek open source API.

## Features

### See All Events

Users can browse through  all events  on the table

### Filter by Liked

Users can like an event, and also show all liked events. Likes are persistent and stay no matter how many times the user closes the app.

### See the Hype

Users will be shown a fire icon when an event has a high popularity rate to entice them to buy tickets.

### Buy Tickets

Users can click on an event to see the details as well as buy tickets for  such  event by redirecting to the SeatGeek webpage.

## Packages, Dependencies & More

None. The application needs no installations prior to being run.
For data persistance, I used CoreData.
